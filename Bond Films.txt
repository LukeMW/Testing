Dr No (1962) - 19/03/19

Theme song: No theme, 0/5

Villian: Rediculous, you don't see him until 20 minutes, and he was meant to be chinese but it was clearly a white guy, 2/5

Bond girl: Really attractive but a little old looking, 4/5

Review: Not bad, it was kinda fun all the way through, some silly plot points including the needlessly elaborate methods to kill bond, no Q gadget scene, the last 20 mins is very anticlimatic and bond destroys the whole villian base by turning a valve and then the villian dies after a 2 min fight with bond by drowning in water, 6/10

From Russia With Love (1963) - 20/03/19

Theme song: Actually had an opening theme this time but it wasn't very good and it was very short, 2/5

Villian: The villian is Blowfeld but that's not the focus, the actual antagonist is the main henchman, pretty good and kind of intimidating, 3/5

Bond girl: Pretty hot blonde, 3/5

Review: A kinda fun watch but seems sparce in terms of story, the bond girl had some relevence to the story this time, however, the villian is almost non-existant and the action ending seems a tad forced, 4/10

Goldfinger (1964) - 21/03/19

Theme song: Really good and catchy, 4/5

Villian: Goldfinger is intelligent, devious and all round believeable, the henchman Oddjob is also very good and quite imtimidating, 4/5

Bond girl: Look quite old, 1/5

Review: Very good Bond film that because the template for all future films in the franchise, good, well paced plot that was both interesting and easy to follow good carchase and action scenes, the bond girl was important to the plot, good villian and henchman, 8/10

Thunderball (1965) - 22/03/19

Theme song: Didn't like it, not the song are the lyrics and really bad titles, 1/5

Villian: An ok villian (Largo), tried his best to be sinister but didn't quite full it off, 2/5

Bond girl: Really hot, 4/5

Review: A fun watch, some silly moments but overall had a simple but effective plot, good location, really good underwater scenes and action set pieces, a villian that served the purpose and a bond girl that had alteast something to do with the plot, 7/10

------

You Only Live Twice (1967) - 23/03/19

Theme song: Pretty good, 3/5

Villian: The classic bond villian, blowfeld is always was a good villian, 4/5

Bond girl: Two japanese girls, pretty good looking, collectively, 3/5

Review: Another fun watch, really good production values, heavy japanese theme that may have come off a bit silly if they hadn't committed to it so hard but they did so it became a interesting aspect of the film, some comically silly plot moments that are part and parcel at this point, good villian, interesting plot and fine bond girls, 8/10

On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) - 24/03/19

Theme song: Ok music but no lyrics, 2/5

Villian: Blowfeld was ruined, he went from a sinister, don't get your hands dirty mastermind to a henchman character that fights bond hand to hand and chases him down ski slopes, 1/5

Bond girl: Ok looking, 2/5

Review: Odd opening that feels like you started watching half way through, badly directed directed, cheap looking, too much low quality green screen, the same song is played over and over at mostly inappropriate times, too long, pacing is really off, very boring throughout, badly edited fight scenes with way too many jump cuts, almost imcomprihenible plot where blowfeld has made some kind of virus to make crops and animals infertile but it was never elaborated upon and was pretty much forgotten, unusually bleak ending that could have just scraped the side of poinent but was ruined by a lack of good acting from lasenby and wholely inappropriate use of the bond theme, lasenby wasn't a good bond, this just isn't a bond film, 1/10

------

Diamonds Are Forever (1971) - 25/03/19

Theme song: Not very good and repetitive, 2/5

Villian: Blowfeld was almost irelivent to the story and he dressed up in drag all to coax a woman into a car, mr wint and mr kid were utter nonsense, they were an apparently homicidal, gay couple that referred to eachother by their sir names, that devolved into comic relief by the end, 1/5

Bond girl: Good looking, awesome body, 3.5/5

Review: Boring, stupidly dense, uninteresting plot, very little action, connery sleep walked through the entire film making it obvious that he was just there for the paycheck, bad, rediculous villians, a bond girl thats completely irelivent to the plot, to the point where she actually hinders bonds efforts at the end, a last fight seen that became unintentional comedy gold because instead of using a gun, the villian decides that the best course of action to finally take down bond is to gran two sheesh kebabs, light them on fire and charge at bond like a raging bull with flaming horns, a bond film where everyone involved in the production clearly didn't care about quality anymore, 2/10

------

Live and Let Die (1973) - 26/03/19

Theme song: Really good, 4/5

Villian: Really good, believable villian, appropriately menacing, good acting and line delivery, 4/5

Bond girl: Really hot, 4/5

Review: A very fun watch, Roger Moore was a good Bond, he was the appropriately smooth, quippy, lady's man secret agent that Connery was in his prime, good, interesting plot that was easy to follow, nicely acted villian, believeable henchman, another bond girl that was relivent to the plot, good action and fight scenes, unique voodoo theme, the only real letdowns were the overly long speed boat chase and the lack of a final showdown that didn't do the quality of the villian justice, overall, a stand out bond film, 8/10
