Dr No (1962) - 19/03/19

Theme song: No theme, 0/5

Villian: Rediculous, you don't see him until 20 minutes, and he was meant to be chinese but it was clearly a white guy, 2/5

Bond girl: Really attractive but a little old looking, 4/5

Review: Not bad, it was kinda fun all the way through, some silly plot points including the needlessly elaborate methods to kill bond, no Q gadget scene, the last 20 mins is very anticlimatic and bond destroys the whole villian base by turning a valve and then the villian dies after a 2 min fight with bond by drowning in water, 6/10

-------

From Russia With Love (1963) - 20/03/19

Theme song: Actually had an opening theme this time but it wasn't very good and it was very short, 2/5

Villian: The villian is Blowfeld but that's not the focus, the actual antagonist is the main henchman, pretty good and kind of intimidating, 3/5

Bond girl: Pretty hot blonde, 3/5

Review: A kinda fun watch but seems sparce in terms of story, the bond girl had some relevence to the story this time, however, the villian is almost non-existant and the action ending seems a tad forced, 4/10

------

Goldfinger (1964) - 21/03/19

Theme song: Really good and catchy, 4/5

Villian: Goldfinger is intelligent, devious and all round believeable, the henchman Oddjob is also very good and quite imtimidating, 4/5

Bond girl: Look quite old, 1/5

Review: Very good Bond film that because the template for all future films in the franchise, good, well paced plot that was both interesting and easy to follow good carchase and action scenes, the bond girl was important to the plot, good villian and henchman, 8/10

------

Thunderball (1965) - 22/03/19

Theme song: Didn't like it, not the song are the lyrics and really bad titles, 1/5

Villian: An ok villian (Largo), tried his best to be sinister but didn't quite full it off, 2/5

Bond girl: Really hot, 4/5

Review: A fun watch, some silly moments but overall had a simple but effective plot, good location, really good underwater scenes and action set pieces, a villian that served the purpose and a bond girl that had alteast something to do with the plot, 7/10

------

You Only Live Twice (1967) - 23/03/19

Theme song: Pretty good, 3/5

Villian: The classic bond villian, blowfeld is always was a good villian, 4/5

Bond girl: Two japanese girls, pretty good looking, collectively, 3/5

Review: Another fun watch, really good production values, heavy japanese theme that may have come off a bit silly if they hadn't committed to it so hard but they did so it became a interesting aspect of the film, some comically silly plot moments that are part and parcel at this point, good villian, interesting plot and fine bond girls, 8/10

------

On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) - 24/03/19

Theme song: Ok music but no lyrics, 2/5

Villian: Blowfeld was ruined, he went from a sinister, don't get your hands dirty mastermind to a henchman character that fights bond hand to hand and chases him down ski slopes, 1/5

Bond girl: Ok looking, 2/5

Review: Odd opening that feels like you started watching half way through, badly directed directed, cheap looking, too much low quality green screen, the same song is played over and over at mostly inappropriate times, too long, pacing is really off, very boring throughout, badly edited fight scenes with way too many jump cuts, almost imcomprihenible plot where blowfeld has made some kind of virus to make crops and animals infertile but it was never elaborated upon and was pretty much forgotten, unusually bleak ending that could have just scraped the side of poinent but was ruined by a lack of good acting from lasenby and wholely inappropriate use of the bond theme, lasenby wasn't a good bond, this just isn't a bond film, 3/10

------

Diamonds Are Forever (1971) - 25/03/19

Theme song: Not very good and repetitive, 2/5

Villian: Blowfeld was almost irelivent to the story and he dressed up in drag all to coax a woman into a car, mr wint and mr kid were utter nonsense, they were an apparently homicidal, gay couple that referred to eachother by their sir names, that devolved into comic relief by the end, 1/5

Bond girl: Good looking, awesome body, 3.5/5

Review: Boring, stupidly dense, uninteresting plot, very little action, connery sleep walked through the entire film making it obvious that he was just there for the paycheck, bad, rediculous villians, a bond girl thats completely irelivent to the plot, to the point where she actually hinders bonds efforts at the end, a last fight seen that became unintentional comedy gold because instead of using a gun, the villian decides that the best course of action to finally take down bond is to gran two sheesh kebabs, light them on fire and charge at bond like a raging bull with flaming horns, a bond film where everyone involved in the production clearly didn't care about quality anymore, 2/10

------

Live and Let Die (1973) - 26/03/19

Theme song: Really good, 4/5

Villian: Really good, believable villian, appropriately menacing, good acting and line delivery, 4/5

Bond girl: Really hot, 4/5

Review: A very fun watch, Roger Moore was a good Bond, he was the appropriately smooth, quippy, lady's man secret agent that Connery was in his prime, good, interesting plot that was easy to follow, nicely acted villian, believeable henchman, another bond girl that was relivent to the plot, good action and fight scenes, unique voodoo theme, the only real letdowns were the overly long speed boat chase and the lack of a final showdown that didn't do the quality of the villian justice, overall, a stand out bond film, 8/10

------

The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) - 27/03/19

Theme song: Really bad, 1/5

Villian: Very bad, hands off villian who was actually carried with the plot like a man with alzimers, to the point where his rediculous midget with an inexplicible french accent henchman had more of an impact on the plot than he did, 1/5

Bond girl: Ok looking blonde, 2/5

Review: Boring, shallow plot, nonsencical villian who's gimmick, apart feom having a third nipple, was the fact he wielded a gold coloured gun that looked like something a blue peter presenter would make for 8 year olds, a villian so bad that this apparently master gunman's preferred method of excution was to make his victims run around in a funhouse full of al capone maniquins and curved mirrors, only to be bested by bond posing as a manquin of himself, all the while knowing that bond himself was bested himself by a untalented sumo wresler whos weakness are inpromtu wedgies and a half naked midget weirlding a pitch fork, all this plus a bond girl who was completly inepted makes this one of the worst bond films i've ever seen, 2/10

------

The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) - 28/03/19

Theme song: Very good, 4/5

Villian: Back to the classic bond villian of hands off mastermind that gives the orders and has the diabolical plan, neede more screen time though 3/5

Bond girl: Pretty good looking but big forehead, 3/5

Review: A fun watch, a more toned down, less campy version of Moore's Bond, which made the chracter much more investible this time around, good bond girl that was more than just relivent to the plot, she was actually the prime supporting character, good mastermind style villian, menencing henchman, made all there more so by the fact he apparently couldn't die and that he can take on sharks with nothing but his bare hands and signiture metal teeth, good props, impressive sets, really nice production all round, good action, there were some plot points taken from You Only Live Twice that made this one feel slightly derivitive but apart from that a solid entry in the franchise, 7/10

------

Moonraker (1979) - 29/03/19

Theme song: Really bad, 1/5

Villian: Mastermind style villian which would normally be a positive but this case, he lacked any kind of screen presence or impact on screen, 2/5

Bond girl: Ok looking but kind of old, 2/5

Review: Pacing is very slow, aimless plot that feels haphazard and sparce, the director clearly had franchise fatigue by this point, a lot of comedy unintentional or otherwise, Jaws, upon realising he's free falling from 20,000 feet without a parachute determines that the best course of action is to flap his arms up and down as if they were wings, the villian apparently thought that a g force machine, a guy perched in a tree with a sniper rifle, another guy hiding in a coffin with his own personal collection of knivess and an asian guy in kendo gear are all very good methods of killing bond, to top it off, the production felt it nessasary to insert a barely featured love story, between Jaws and a random girl, the space battle at the end was cheap looking nonsence, mediocre bond girl that has only minor impact on the plot, Jaws has a change of heart and starts helping bond after one sentence of dialogue, one of the worst bond films i've seen, 2/10

------

For Your Eyes Only (1981) - 02/04/19

Theme song: Pretty good, 3/5

Villian: The villian is unique in the for part of the film, he's a good guy, after he becomes the villian, he has no real impact on the story, and almost no screen presence, 2/5

Bond girl: Ok, 2/5

Review: Really bad comedy opening where bond is at the mercy of a remote controlled helicopter that is being piloted by disabled blowfeld, his plan fails splectacularly when bond gains control of the helicopter, picks up blowfeld's wheelchair and procedes to drop him down a massive chimney, the story is at best incoherent and at worst incomprihenible, the random comedy moments call flat, the production while serviceable is lackluster, in the end, forgettable, boring and drab, the definition of mediocre, 3/10

-------

Never Say Never Again (1983) - 03/04/19

Theme song: Really bad, 1/5

Villian: Passible male villian that plays it just subtly enough to be believeable, the female villian on the other hand is pretty good, she gets a lot of screen time and the character is shown to have genuine pychological problems that is unique and adds to the sence of menace, collectively, 3/5

Bond girl: Pretty hot, 3/5

Review: Good, action orientated opening that sets the tone for the entire film in that connery puts maximum effort into the bond character this time around and the film as a whole is more enjoyable because of it, however, the ending action set piece that was so impressive and memorable in Thunderball, was lackluster and overly abrupt in this one, but good action scenes, a pretty passable villian and an interresting, easily understanable plot all make this unofficial bond film, a fine entry in the franchise, 6/10

------

Octopussy (1983) - 04/04/19

Theme song: Not very good, 2/5

Villian: Not bad villian, probably most comparable to the sophisicated, master plan villian that was Goldfinger, 3/5

Bond girl: Ok looking but too old, 2/5

Review: Not a bad bond film, better than expected in fact, good action, varied, exotic locations, a woman in a prominant power position role which was interesting, impressive stunts, however, the comedy moments were too numerous and overly pervasive to the point of being distracting(case in point, bond in a gorrila suit for a full 10 minutes then he dresses up as a clown), the plot became slow, silly and plodding towards the end, all in all though, not a bad bond film but not an overly good one either, 5/10

-------

A View To A Kill (1985) - 05/04/19

Theme song: Really good, 5/5

Villian: Boring, uninteresting villian will all the menace of a dead gold fish, the henchman grave jones was marginally better but completely over shadowed with the shear lack of effort ffrom chris walken, collectively, 2/5

Bond girl: Really hot, really nice blue eyes, 4/5

Review: Uninspired, derivitive chase sequence opening made all the worse by the random beach boys music that plays during the chase scene, bad villian, wholely uninteresting plot, lackluster performance from roger moore who looks so old at this point that he would be more at home in a film like cocoon than a bond movie, the one saving grace was the scene towards the end when chris walken inexplicably decides to mow down every single worker in a cave with a machine gun, not because the scene was good but because it was so ridiculous, this film is best described with 3 words, boring, boring, boring, yes, that's actually one word but it so accurately describes the film, i feel I have to say it 3 times, 2/10

------

The Living Daylights (1987) - 06/04/19

Theme song: Quite good, 3/5

Villian: Two villians have pretty much equal screen time, what they lacked in overall menace, they made up for in quality of their scheme, good henchman too, collectively, 3/5

Bond girl: No bad looking, 3/5

Review: Good action opening, possinly the best potrayal of bond I've seen so far, dalton gives the character a hard edge, and air of prefessionalism, not seen in previous films to the point that I feel that is how bond is supposed to carry himself, he also shows genuine emotion which serves to humanise him and makes him all the more investible, good interesting plot, perfectly passable villians, the best bond girl I've seen so far in terms of plot importance and general likability, an actual believeable relationship between bond and the girl that was well written and sweet, clearly shows real effort in maintaining that particular subplot which unusual for a bond film but a welcome change, goof supporting characters and ending make this, one of the best bond films, i've seen, 8/10

-------

Licence To Kill (1989) - 07/04/19

Theme song: Pretty good, 3/5

Villian: Very strong villian that has a lot of screen time and development, suitably menacing, 4/5

Bond girl: Pretty good looking, 3/5

Review: Good, frequent action, impressive stunts, an interesting revenge story that is an interesting departure from the standard bond movie plot, more violent, than usual, daltons bond is once again hard edged, emotive and believable, fine villian, good relevent bond girl, however, revenge plot feels sparce, and suffers from pacing issues from about half way through, making the latter half drag somewhat, overall though, another good dalton outing as bond, 6/10

------

GoldenEye (1995) - 09/04/19

Theme song: Very good, 4/5

Villian: Very good, well developed, menaceing villian, with an actual backstory that makes him engaging and believable, 4/5

Bond girl: Pretty hot, 3/5

Review: Good, action opening, interesting plot that had just enough scope to make it suitably over the top in true bond movie fasion, impressive stunts, good bond girl that was properly linked to the plot, one of the best villians i've seen, the female hentchman was unique and fun in an odd way, there was some effort put into giving the friend-turned-enemy subplot some emotional wieght but brosnan didn't quite pull it off, and that brings me to the worst aspect of the film and that is bond himself, brosnan, although clearly trying, simply doesn't have the screen presence or acting talent to do an iconic character like bond justice, he walks around each scene like the invisible man, in that i almost forgot he was there, he doesn't have the impact or charisma other bond actors did, this problem is only worsened by the fact that sean bean outshines brosnan in pretty much every aspect of the performance, bean had better presence, better line delivery, he was simply a better actor, because of that, an arguement can be made that sean bean would have made a better bond than pierce bronan, but alas, we'll never know,  all, in all though, an enjoyable bond film, discounting bond himself of course, 7/10

------

Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) - 10/04/19

Theme song: Really bad, 1/5

Villian: Horrendously bad villian that has all the menace of a puppy, a permformance so blatently over the top that he becomes a parody, that no one could possibly take seriously, 1/5

Bond girl: Ok looking asian girl, 2/5

Review: Before re-watching brosnan's outing as bond, I was under the woefully inaccurate impression that brosnan was a perfectly find bond, in point of fact, it turns out, I was very, very wrong, put simply, Brosnan is a bad bond in just about every way possible, but whereas his performance in GoldenEye was somewhat forgivable because he was mostly over shadowed by the other aspects of the film, unfortuntely, the same cannot be said for this film, because it is just as bad as brosnan himself, brosnan once again dons his alter ego as the invisible man, again, no impact or screen presence at all, he floats through the film like an insubstantial ghost, really bad action, a laughabably bad villian whos diabolical master plan involves being on tv in lots of places and whos horrible performance is only trumped by bond himself, a nonance bond girl who becomes bond's only ally and partner within 10 minutes of meeting her, a story so wildly uninteresting, i found it more entertaining thinking about what i was going to have to dinner tomorrow,

It's suprising to me that this film has quite literally no redeeming qualities apart from how impressive it is that Q is still alive, in the end, tomorrow never dies will remain etched in my memory for one reason alone, and that is because it is which out question, objectively, catagorically awful, 1/5

------

The World Is Not Enough (1999) - 11/04/19

Theme song: Ok, nothing special, 2/5

Villian: Robert Carlyle is unexpectedly bad has the villian, he tries to give the character some depth and sense od inner pain but it ends up alienating the audience, the villian disn't command much attention at all to the point where i didn't even know what the end goal of his master plan was, 2/5

Bond girl: Both are really hot, 5/5

Review: Good action opening that may have been a little on the long side, i'm pleased to say that brosnan is much better in the role of bond this time around, he puts some real effort in, he shows emotion, has more dialogue that's delivered atleast semi compatantly, he was serious when the scene called for it and playful when it didn't, he did indeed have an impact on the film this time and it's better because of it, there's good action, robbie contrane's death actually manged to be poinient, testiment to the improvement in writing but the plot itself was less impressive, case in point, the largest negative was the low quality of the villian, so much so that it allowed the henchman bond girl to portray the villian, and do a much berter jon in that role, over all though, a fine bond film, 5/10

------

Die Another Day (2002) - 12/04/19

Theme song: Really bad, 0/5

Villian: Very bad, unimpactful villian who's so-called "try to sound angry and evil" line delivery is so bad that it borders on cringy, 1/5

Bond girl: Really hot 4/5

Review: Pretty good action opening, however, that's pretty much where the positives end, unfortunately, brosnan has gone back to his favourite alter ego, the invisible man, he is once again a non-entity who has about as much significants in the film as the new Q does, a wave surfing scene so badly produced that i've seen better water effects in rapid racer on PS1, there's a fencing scene between bond and the villian that i guess is meant to set the tone for the rivalry linking them, however, it is actually mind numbingly stupid, because bond won the first round, the villian goes berserk and apparently thinks it's a good idea at that point to have an all out sword fight to the death in the middle of a country club in front of 100 witnesses, speaking of the villian, he is out and out terrible, through a conviluted story contrivance, the white villian is actually a chinese guy that has the uncanny ability not only to speak perfect english but to also adopt a flawless upper class english accent, also, towards the end, he wears a metal suit that looks like blue peter made robocop and an electric glove that scrapheap challange would be proud of, the contant slow motion effect in action scenes is clearly meant to be cinematic but ends up looking like a cheap stand in for the absence of good choreography

The bond girl is also completely irelivent to the story, in the end, the one positive i can take from this messy, incompetant nonsence of a bond film is the heartwarming, comforting knowledge that i won't watch this travesty ever again, 0/10
