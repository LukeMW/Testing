Dr No (1962) - 19/03/19

Theme song: No theme, 0/5

Villian: Rediculous, you don't see him until 20 minutes, and he was meant to be chinese but it was clearly a white guy, 2/5

Bond girl: Really attractive but a little old looking, 4/5

Review: Not bad, it was kinda fun all the way through, some silly plot points including the needlessly elaborate methods to kill bond, no Q gadget scene, the last 20 mins is very anticlimatic and bond destroys the whole villian base by turning a valve and then the villian dies after a 2 min fight with bond by drowning in water, 3/5

From Russia With Love (1963) - 20/03/19

Theme song: Actually had an opening theme this time but it wasn't very good and it was very short, 2/5

Villian: The villian is Blowfeld but that's not the focus, the actual antagonist is the main henchman, pretty good and kind of intimidating, 3/5

Bond girl: Pretty hot blonde, 3/5

Review: A kinda fun watch but seems sparce in terms of story, the bond girl had some relevence to the story this time, however, the villian is almost non-existant and the action ending seems a tad forced, 2/5

Goldfinger (1964) - 21/03/19

Theme song: Really good and catchy, 4/5

Villian: Goldfinger is intelligent, devious and all round believeable, the henchman Oddjob is also very good and quite imtimidating, 4/5

Bond girl: Look quite old, 1/5

Review: Very good Bond film that because the template for all future films in the franchise, good, well paced plot that was both interesting and easy to follow good carchase and action scenes, the bond girl was important to the plot, good villian and henchman, 4/5

Thunderball (1965) - 22/03/19

Theme song: Didn't like it, not the song are the lyrics and really bad titles, 1/5

Villian: An ok villian (Largo), tried his best to be sinister but didn't quite full it off, 2/5

Bond girl: Really hot, 4/5

Review: A fun watch, some silly moments but overall had a simple but effective plot, good location, really good underwater scenes and action set pieces, a villian that served the purpose and a bond girl that had alteast something to do with the plot, 3.5/5
