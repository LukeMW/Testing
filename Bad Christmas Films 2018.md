# Bad Christmas Films 2018

Nath, Josh and myself are picking 3 each of the worst Christmas films we can find and we're all going to watch one a day. As we watch each one, we'll each rate them out of 5. After we've watched all 9, we will reveal our scores and whoever has the total lowest rating for their 3 picks is the winner. The winner gets a full week of film picks.

- The Nutcracker in 3D (2009) - Got it
- Christmas Evil (1980) - Got it, it might actually be too good to pick, it has a 5.3 on IMDb
- Surviving Christmas (2004) - Got it, this might have to replace a pick
- Deck the Halls (2006)
- Santa Claws (1996) - I can't get it I don't think, there's a 2014 film of the same name that's supposed to be really bad as well, but I don't think I'll be able to get that film either
- Santa With Muscles (1996) - Josh picked it first
- Elves (1989) - Josh pick it first
