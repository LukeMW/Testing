# Talisman Notes

## Cataclysm Info
- There are Denizens for every encounter available on the Cataclysm ravaged locations.
- You can still complete the quests (like Visit the Enchantress) and discard Followers (such as The Hag being dispelled by the Mystic) that require you to visit any of them, but it now requires you to draw those Denizens first.
- If the location you encounter them on matches one of the ones on the card, the Denizen sticks around, otherwise the Denizen will leave (unless the card specifies otherwise).
